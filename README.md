# Task-5-Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forests

🌳 Task 5: Decision Trees & Random Forest
📌 Objective

To implement and understand tree-based classification models using the Heart Disease Dataset.

🛠 Tools Used

Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

🚀 Steps Performed

Loaded and split the dataset

Trained a Decision Tree classifier

Visualized the decision tree

Analyzed overfitting (compared train vs test accuracy)

Controlled overfitting using max_depth

Trained a Random Forest model

Compared model accuracy

Evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation

Interpreted feature importance

📊 Result

Random Forest performed better and reduced overfitting compared to a single Decision Tree.

✅ Conclusion

Tree-based models are powerful and interpretable. Random Forest improves accuracy and stability using ensemble learning.
